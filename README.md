# NSS_Analytics_Jumpstart
## This repository is comprised of the data files and the Jupyter Notebooks I used to perform analysis in. The "Jumpstart Analysis" notebook is the main notebook I used to conduct an ongoing analysis as I progressed through the month-long analytics jumpstart class at Nashville Software School. I used the "Group Project" iPython notebook to conduct an analysis for my portion of our group project, which you will see the presentation slides for in the "NSS Presentation" pdf.
